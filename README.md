## Filter Bypasses

### Disable LanSchool Air
**Follow these steps each time you login:**
1. Login, and wait for the LanSchool Air app to load
2. Open a new tab and go to `chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
3. On all the scopes that start with `chrome-extension://`, press the "Unregister" button
4. Forcibly close LanSchool by right clicking the app on the bottom appbar and pressing "Close"
5. As usual, LanSchool will reopen, however, it won't be connected and will say "Not Connected" in bottom left corner 

### Lightspeed Filter Agent

### FortiClient Chromebook WebFilter Extension

2. Open `Windows PowerShell`
3. Run `cd Downloads` (or whichever folder your `.exe` file is located in)
3. Run `Copy .\filename C:\Windows\Temp\filename` replacing `filename` with the name of your file.
4. Run `C:\Windows\Temp\filename` replacing `filename` with the name of your file.
5. The program will open.

### IStealYourDNS
**This exploit involves changing your DNS settings to bypass network-wide filters. If your school also uses (an) extension(s), you'll want to also use the (Disable Extensions)[#disable-extensions] exploit. Also, you'll have to do this for every network you connect to.**
1. Open your Wifi's DNS settings (chromebook howto)[https://www.howtogeek.com/204672/how-to-change-the-dns-server-on-a-chromebook/]
